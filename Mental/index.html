                <h3>What is the problem we're solving? </h3>

                <p><b>Mental health struggles, stress, and burnout</b> are increasingly common ‚Äî especially among students and young adults. With busy schedules, academic pressure, social media, and constant stimulation, it‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed and disconnected.
                    <br> <br> This affects <b>people of all ages</b>, but especially teens and young adults who may not have easy access to mental health resources or who feel unsure about where to start.
                </p>

                <h4>Why is it important? </h4>

                <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Learning how to manage stress, slow down, and take care of your mind can lead to better focus, healthier relationships, and an overall happier life. But self-care shouldn't feel like a chore. <br> <br>
                    That‚Äôs why we created <b>Mindful Garden</b> ‚Äî a calming space where players are gently guided to take care of their mental health through <b>fun, simple, and rewarding activities </b>like breathing, journaling, and using the Pomodoro technique. In return, players help bunnies grow a beautiful, peaceful garden ‚Äî reinforcing the idea that nurturing your mind leads to growth and balance.
